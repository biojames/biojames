## About me

Welcome to my homepage. I am a biomedical scientist specialised in structural biology and interested in the interplay between evolutionary processes and 
protein structure and function. Details of my publications can be found on [my ORCID page](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3204-6356),
my [NCBI-NLM bibliography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/1hoIhHdqaTQ/bibliography/public/) 
and my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5x7VYeYAAAAJ).

## Programs, scripts and code snippets

Here you will find an assortment of small programs and helper scripts that
I've written over the years for processing biological sequence, structural and image data. This is intended
primarily as an effort to introduce some kind of curation to my collection, but my hope is that some
of the code or the ideas underlying it will find its way into other projects. Most of the code is Python or Perl,
some in C and C++, with a smattering of other languages.
